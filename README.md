## Why use it?

If you want to excel as a QA engineer, software tester, or automation expert, mastering API testing is essential. APIs are the backbone of modern software systems, and understanding how to test them ensures that the applications you work on are robust, reliable, and scalable.

Whether you're just starting your journey in quality assurance or you're an experienced professional looking to expand your skill set, this guide will help you.  

When I began exploring API testing, I didn't know the difference between REST and SOAP, let alone how to validate API responses or design automated API tests. I had no idea how to set up tools like Postman, write API test scripts, or integrate API monitoring into a CI/CD pipeline. I thought API testing was just about sending requests and checking responses—it’s so much more than that!

API testing requires understanding protocols, authentication methods, performance validation, and much more. While it may seem overwhelming at first, this guide is designed to break it down into manageable steps so anyone, from hobbyists to seasoned professionals, can succeed.

It’s a detailed roadmap, and depending on your familiarity with the concepts, it may take days or even weeks to master. But by the end, you'll have the confidence and skills to handle API testing, automation, and monitoring like a pro.

**Let’s get started and build a strong foundation in API testing!**
